This is something that\nhappens only once every eight years. The Ninth Vestibule is remarkable for the three great Staircases it\ncontains. Its Walls are lined with marble Statues, hundreds upon hundreds\nof them, Tier upon Tier, rising into the distant heights. I climbed up the Western Wall until I reached the Statue of a Woman\ncarrying a Beehive, fifteen metres above the Pavement. The Woman is two\nor three times my own height and the Beehive is covered with marble Bees\nthe size of my thumb. One Bee – this always gives me a slight sensation of\nqueasiness – crawls over her left Eye. I squeezed Myself into the Woman’s\nNiche and waited until I heard the Tides roaring in the Lower Halls and felt\nthe Walls vibrating with the force of what was about to happen. First came the Tide from the Far Eastern Halls. This Tide ascended the\nEasternmost Staircase without violence. It had no colour to speak of and its\nWaters were no more than ankle deep. It spread a grey mirror across the\nPavement, the surface of which was marbled with streaks of milky Foam. Next came the Tide from the Western Halls. This Tide thundered up\nthe Westernmost Staircase and hit the Eastern Wall with a great Clap,\nmaking all the Statues tremble. Its Foam was the white of old fishbones,\nand its churning depths were pewter.",

Yet it has occurred to me that there\nmay be more wisdom in birds than appears at first sight, a wisdom that\nreveals itself only obliquely and intermittently. Once – it was an evening in Autumn – I came to the Doorway of the\nTwelfth South-Eastern Hall intending to pass through the Seventeenth\nVestibule. I found that I was unable to enter it; the Vestibule was full of\nbirds and the birds were all aflight. They circled and spiralled, creating a\nwhirling dance. They filled the Vestibule like a column of smoke, which\ngrew darker and denser in places and the next moment lighter and airier. I\nhave witnessed this dance on several occasions, always in the evening and\nin the later months of the year. Another time I entered the Ninth Vestibule and found it full of little\nbirds. They were of different kinds, but mostly sparrows. I had not taken\nmore than a few steps into the Vestibule when a large group of them took to\nthe Air. They flew together in one great swoop up to the Eastern Wall, then\nin another swoop to the Southern Wall and then they turned and flew\naround me in a loose spiral. ‘Good morning,’ I said. ‘I hope that you are well?’\nMost of the birds scattered to different perches, but a handful – maybe\nas many as ten – flew to the Statue of a Gardener in the North-West Corner. They remained there for perhaps thirty seconds and then, still together, they\nascended to a higher Statue on the Western Wall: the Woman carrying a\nBeehive.",

I wondered why out of the thousand or so Statues in the Vestibule the\nlittle birds had chosen these two to perch on. It occurred to me – it was no\nmore than an idle thought – that both these Statues might be said to\nrepresent Industriousness. The Gardener is old and bent, and yet he digs\nfaithfully in his garden. The Woman is pursuing her profession of\nbeekeeping and the Beehive that she carries is full of bees who are also\npatiently carrying out their tasks. Were the birds telling me that I ought to\nbe industrious too? That seemed unlikely. After all I was already\nindustrious! I was at that very moment on my way to the Eighth Vestibule\nto fish.

That day I caught seven fish and four\nlobsters. I threw none of them back. That night a Wind came from the West, bringing an unexpected Storm. The Tides were made turbulent and the fish were driven away from their\ncustomary Halls far out to Sea. For the next two days there were no fish at\nall and if I had not attended to the birds’ warning I would have had hardly\nanything to eat. This experience led me to form a hypothesis: perhaps the wisdom of\nbirds resides, not in the individual, but in the flock, the congregation. I have\ntried to think of an experiment that would test this theory. The problem, as I\nsee it, is that it is impossible to know in advance when such events will\noccur; and so the only viable course of action is months – more likely years\n– of careful observation and meticulous record keeping. Unfortunately, this\nis not possible just now since so much of my time is taken up by my work\nwith the Other (I refer of course to our search for the Great and Secret\nKnowledge). However, it is with this hypothesis in mind that I record something\nwhich happened this morning. I entered the Second North-Eastern Hall and, as had happened in the\nNinth Vestibule, I found it full of small birds of different sorts. I called a\ncheerful Good morning! to them.

What is the\nmeaning? An angel with a trumpet and a ship. An angel with a trumpet suggests\na message. A joyful message? Perhaps. But an angel might also bring a\nstern or solemn message. Therefore the character of the message, whether\ngood or bad, remains uncertain. The ship suggests travelling long distances. A message coming from afar. A book and clouds. A book contains Writing. Clouds hide what is\nthere. Writing that is somehow obscure. A child and mice. The child represents the quality of Innocence. The\nmice are devouring the grain. Little by little it is diminished. Innocence that\nis worn down or eroded. So this, as far as I can tell, is what the birds told me. A message from\nafar. Obscure Writing. Innocence eroded. Interesting.

Anyone\nwho dared to question him was subjected to a savage raking-over of\nall their failings, personal and academic.

When she was a teenager D’Agostino told a friend that she\nwanted to go to university to study Death, Stars and Mathematics. Inexplicably the University of Manchester didn’t offer such a course,\nso she settled for Mathematics. At the university she quickly stumbled\nupon Laurence Arne-Sayles and his lectures; that encounter shaped\nthe remainder of her life. Arne-Sayles’s talk of communing with ancient minds and glimpses\ninto other worlds answered all her cosmic longings – the ‘Death and\nStars’ part of her. As soon as her Mathematics degree had concluded,\nshe switched to Anthropology with Arne-Sayles as her supervisor. Of all Arne-Sayles’s students and acolytes D’Agostino was by far\nthe most devoted. He assigned her a room in his house in Whalley\nRange where she became his unpaid housekeeper and secretary. She\nhad a car (Arne-Sayles did not drive) and part of her duties consisted\nof driving him wherever he wanted to go, including to Canal Street on\nSaturday nights to pick up young men. In 1984 she gained her doctorate. She did not seek out academic\nor teaching work, but stayed at Arne-Sayles’s side, taking a string of\nmenial jobs to support herself.

Quite what Arne-Sayles was trying to achieve by keeping Ritter\nprisoner is still a matter for debate. Two theories have been put\nforward. The first is that Arne-Sayles brainwashed Ritter in order to lend\ncredence to his claims that other worlds not only existed, but that he\nand other people had been there. Certainly, Ritter’s description of the\nhouse is similar to the vast, empty rooms in Sylvia D’Agostino’s film,\nThe Castle; it is also similar to Arne-Sayles’s own description of the\nother world in the book he wrote in prison: The Labyrinth. (Of course,\nit is perfectly possible that Arne-Sayles simply elaborated on Ritter’s\nhallucinations.) But if that was Arne-Sayles’s aim – to manufacture\nevidence of another world – then why did he choose a man with a\nhistory of delusional illness as his witness? The second theory was that the kidnapping had less to do with\nArne-Sayles’s Other World theories than with his outré sexual tastes. (This was the line the prosecution took at the trial in October 1997.) But in that case why was Ritter babbling about houses with seas in the\nbasement? Angharad Scott attempted to interview Ritter for her biography of\nArne-Sayles, but Ritter had taken offence that no one believed him\nabout the house with the ocean imprisoned in it and he refused to\nspeak to her. In 2010 a Guardian journalist – Lysander Weeks –\ntracked him down for a retrospective piece on the Arne-Sayles scandal. At this point Ritter was working as a caretaker for Manchester Town\nHall.

Arne-Sayles was most interested in Marepool III, the head. Arne-\nSayles said that he had performed a divination that had identified the\nhead as belonging to a king and a seer. The knowledge the seer had\npossessed was exactly what Arne-Sayles needed to further his own\nresearches. Combined with his own theories, it would result in a water-\nshed moment for human understanding. In May 1976 Arne-Sayles\nwrote a letter to the director of the museum, asking to borrow the head\nso that he could perform a magical rite of his own invention, transfer\nthe seer’s knowledge to himself and so usher in a New Age for\nMankind.

At half-past ten I began to walk between the First Vestibule and the\nSixth North-Western Hall; I followed the Path laid down in 16’s directions. I trod this Path six times, but I did not find her. I was growing extremely\nanxious. I returned to the First Vestibule. It was now half-past eleven. Two\nHalls West and North of here, in the Ninth Vestibule, the first Tide was\nalready ascending the Easternmost Staircase. A delicate Wash of Water was\nscuttling over the Pavements of the surrounding Halls. There was nothing for it. I must look for the Other.",

None of these items has been found in his house or office. The police think that possibly he used the inflatable kayak to travel to\na remote spot and then used the gun to kill himself; but there is one officer,\na man called Jamie Askill, who has a different idea. He believes that the\nsudden and unexpected disappearance of Dr Ketterley must be linked in\nsome way to the sudden and unexpected reappearance of Matthew Rose\nSorensen. Askill’s theory is that Ketterley imprisoned Rose Sorensen\nsomewhere, in the same way that Ketterley’s one-time supervisor and tutor,\nLaurence Arne-Sayles, imprisoned James Ritter years before. Ketterley’s\nmotive, thinks Askill, was the same as Arne-Sayles’s: to manufacture\nevidence of Arne-Sayles’s Theory of Other Worlds. Ketterley became\nalarmed when the police uncovered the link between himself and Rose\nSorensen. Faced with the exposure of his crimes, Ketterley let Rose\nSorensen go and then killed himself.

He had more than a dozen suits (which I\nfind surprising considering that his income was not large). This love of\nclothes was something he shared with Piranesi. Piranesi frequently wrote\nabout Dr Ketterley’s clothes in his journal and lamented the contrast with\nhis own ragged garments. This, I suppose, is where I differ from both of\nthem – from Matthew Rose Sorensen and Piranesi; I find I do not care\ngreatly about clothes.

It shows a queen in a chariot, the protector of her\npeople. She is all goodness, all gentleness, all wisdom, all motherhood. That is Piranesi’s view of Raphael, because Raphael saved him. But I choose a different statue. In my mind Raphael is better\nrepresented by a statue in an antechamber that lies between the forty-fifth\nand the sixty-second northern halls. This statue shows a figure walking\nforward, holding a lantern. It is hard to determine with any certainty the\ngender of the figure; it is androgynous in appearance.
